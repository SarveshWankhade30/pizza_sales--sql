# Pizza Sales SQL Project

## Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to provide insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue distribution. The project is divided into three levels of complexity: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, with specific queries and analyses tailored to each level.

---

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To retrieve key sales metrics, such as total orders and revenue.
- To identify customer preferences, including popular pizza types and sizes.
- To perform advanced revenue analysis for business optimization.

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple tables related to pizza sales. Key tables include:

- **Orders**: Contains details of each order.
- **Pizzas**: Includes information about different pizza types and their prices.
- **Categories**: Describes the category of each pizza (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg).
- **Order Details**: Links orders with the specific pizzas ordered.

## Analysis Levels

### 1. Basic

- **Retrieve the total number of orders placed.**
- **Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.**
- **Identify the highest-priced pizza.**
- **Identify the most common pizza size ordered.**
- **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.**

### 2. Intermediate

- **Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.**
- **Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.**
- **Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.**
- **Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.**
- **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.**

### 3. Advanced

- **Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.**
- **Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.**
- **Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.**
